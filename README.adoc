= Database creation for CEC database

The included db script with HCL Connections only creates the database and gives real high database rights to the database user `lcuser`.

I often found environments, where DB2 administrators don't allow that, or reset the access rights on a regular basis.

So these two scripts can create the needed database:

[source]
----
db2 -td@ -vf createDb.sql
----

or if you already have the database (normally CEC creates the database during startup, when the access rights are high enough), you can limit the access rights of `lcuser` to connect to the database and delete, insert, select and update to all tables.

I tested the access and CEC seems to work normally.

I forwarded the code to HCL and hope that support will proove it.
